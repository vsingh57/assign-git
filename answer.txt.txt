A gitignore file contains the list of files and directories to exclude from version control. For a Java project, it could be the .project file
in Eclipse that contains the paths and other device specific information that one would not want to push to the remote repository as it could lead to
unneccessary errors and conflicts.
Fast-forward refers to merging a branch into another, when there are no errors or merge conflicts, and no further action is required to complete the merge.
A project needs different branches so that each team member can make their own small changes without having to constantly deal with others' changes, and
merge it to the main branch when they are done. Moreover, this also helps to contain bugs and errors in task specific branches, so that the main branch
of the project is always clean and contains working software.
A project usually has one remote repository.
